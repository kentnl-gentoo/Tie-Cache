$MODULE = "Tie::Cache"; $VERSION = .06; $DATE = 2/16/99;

+ WriteSynch config option for TRUE CACHE.  WriteSynch => 0 
  will have the dirty data be written back as late as possible.  
  WriteSynch => 1 is immediate write-through for data dirtied.
- STORE returns value stored; $cache{$key} = $value returns $value now
+ decomped FETCH better so it doesn't use STORE internally
  necessary for new WriteSynch functionality
+ WriteSynch => 0 config set in test.pl to demostrate use.
+ Optimizations, especially for refreshing entries in cache on FETCH

$MODULE = "Tie::Cache"; $VERSION = .05;

+ Keep track of hits / misses even without debug option set.

$MODULE = "Tie::Cache"; $VERSION = .04;

$MODULE = "Tie::Cache"; $VERSION = .031;

- Global destructor bug fixed.  Wasn't flushing cache consistently.

$MODULE = "Tie::Cache"; $VERSION = .02;

+ MaxBytes config option is new.  It allows cache size to 
  be based on the bytes the cache holds.
+ test.pl output has Debug set to 2, so full debugging output is
  displayed.  This allows a new user to see how cache works.
